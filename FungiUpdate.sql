Some occur as single, upright, club-like structures. Others, as illustrated here, are clustered and highly branched. Some forms have flattened brances giving them a leafy appearance.

The fertile surface may be smooth, rough, or bumpy but never forms pores, gills, or teeth.

These fungi are fleshy and the gills are readilyseparable from the rest of the mushroom. Certain poroid fungi (e.g., Lenzites betulina, Gloeophyllum sepiarium) have pores which \'break down\' and form gill-like structures.

These holes are the openings of tubes these fungi form. Spores form on the interior walls of the tubes. Pores maybe large (e.g., each over 1 mm diameter) or very small (5-7 pores per linear mm). Use a 10x hand lens before deciding your specimen does not form pores.','poroid.jpg'),(8,'Puffball and Cushion','If the fungus has the general shape \n  							of a ball, then it is placed in this category. \n  							The ball-like structure may be somewhat compressed \n  							(cushion-shaped) or pear- shaped or turban-shaped. It may \n  							be stalked or sessile, hard or soft, smooth or lumpy. These organisms do not have the \'open\' or \'flat top\' look of the cup and saucer \n                             fungi. They do not have the peridioles of the bird\'s nest fungi. They are not as narrow in relation to their height as are the club and coral fungi nor do they form branches.','puffball.jpg'),(9,'Stinkhorn','Stinkhorn fungi would fall into the \n  							club, coral, and leafy shape category but for one feature: \n  							at maturity, the terminal portion of the stalk-like stinkhorn \n  							is covered by a brownish-green, foul-smelling gooey slime. \n  							The slime is loaded with spores and attracts flies which disperse the spores.','stinkhorn.jpg'),(17,'Teeth and Spine','Fungi in this group form either flattened teeth-like structures or rounded spine-like structures which are either 1)) oriented \n downward (pendulous) in contrast to the upright stalks of the club, coral, and leafy group or 2) occur as a spreading mass of spines or teeth on the substrate. In the latter case, the teeth/spines \n are tough in texture and just a few millimeters long. Certain poroid fungi (e.g. Irpex lacteus, Carrena unicolor) have pores which break down to form \'teeth.\'','teeth.jpg');
