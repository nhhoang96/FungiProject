                <h2>Dr. Gary Emberger</h2>
                <p>I'm a professor of biology at Messiah College where I've taught since 1981. 
				   My interest in fungi began in a formal manner through the introductory mycology 
				   course I took at Penn State. In spring term, 1974, I took BIOL 418 Mycology with 
				   Dr. C. Leonard Fergus as the instructor. Dr. Fergus loved the fungi and during 
				   the course I caught some of his passion for this group of organisms. As a result, 
				   I'm quite certain I'd still be involved with mushrooms as a hobby even if I did 
				   not teach mycology and biology as a profession. In any event, I combined my 
				   interest in plants with my new interest in mycology and completed graduate work 
				   in plant pathology at both Penn State and at North Carolina State University. 
				   While at NCSU, I took PP 625 Advanced Mycology in the fall of 1978, taught by 
				   Dr. Larry Grand. I still fondly remember staying up all night (the only time I
				   ever did this) to complete a collection of fungal specimens to be turned in as 
				   part of the final grade. I reminded him of this at the 2004 NAMA meetings in
							North Carolina! In the plant pathology world of microscopic plant pathogens, 
							PP 625 provided an interesting contrast in studying some of the macroscopic fungi.
							Larry is one of the contributing photographers for the site.</p>
				<p>In the early years of teaching mycology at Messiah College, my students collected 
							a number of specimens which they could not identify. Neither could I with any 
							confidence. Eastern Penn Mushroomers did not exist and I turned to Dr. Fergus at 
							Penn State for help. He graciously offered his assistance. Many of the specimens 
							I took to him were wood decay species. As I became more proficient at identifying 
							wood decay fungi I appreciated their usefulness in teaching a mycology course with 
							a field collection requirement. Even when conditions were too dry for terrestrial 
							fungi, my students could almost always find fungi on logs, stumps, and decaying wood. 
							In addition, many of the species are simply beautiful and often spectacular. My 
							appreciation for this group of fungi continues to deepen over the years.</p>
				<p>
							Because of my contact with Dr. Fergus, I was aware of his book Illustrated Genera
							of Wood Decay Fungi. I was intrigued by the concept of a key to fungi which are 
							restricted to a specific habitat, in this case, wood. The idea slowly developed 
							in my mind that a web-based identification guide to fungi growing on wood would 
							make for an interesting academic project. It would be an updated version of the 
							out-of-print Illustrated Genera of Wood Decay Fungi. I felt a need existed for 
							this kind of guide. And, can there ever be too many field guides to fungi? 
							Following a time as department chair, the opportunity presented itself to pursue 
							this project. I started work on the web site in 2003.
