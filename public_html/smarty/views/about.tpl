				<h2>What We Do</h2>

				<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Fungi Growing on Wood is a web
				site devoted to the identification and appreciation of fungi
				growing in close association with living and dead wood. The
				fungi described here are those in a parasitic or saprophytic
				relationship with trees. Mycorrhizal fungi, also in close
				association with trees, are not strongly represented here even
				though some of them may be found on well-rotted wood. The
				organisms described on this web site are often referred to as
				lignicolous fungi. Most species are illustrated with multiple
				images to show as many diagnostic details as possible. To my
				knowledge, no guide similar to this exists.</p>

				<p><strong>Area of Usefulness:</strong> The keys were developed
				for fungi in the Northeastern United States. As with all
				regional keys, coverage decreases toward the periphery of the
				specified range. Many of the species included in these pages
				are distributed much more widely than the indicated area.</p>

				<p><strong>Approach to Identification:</strong> Identification
				of lignicolous fungi at this site requires the use of
				dichotomous keys based on macroscopic characters. By
				restricting the web site to lignicolous fungi, many, many other
				fungi are excluded. By excluding terrestrial fungi and fungi
				restricted to other substrates, a much smaller subset of
				organisms is defined. Consequently, the identification process
				is simplified.</p>

				<p><strong>Importance of Fungi on Wood:</strong> Lignicolous
				fungi are important. As a group, they play a vital role in
				recycling the nutrients locked up in wood. Economically, some
				species are capable of killing or damaging valuable timber and
				landscape trees. From a hobbyist perspective, no matter what
				time of year or the weather, it is almost always possible to
				find fungi on wood and they have saved many a foray from coming
				up empty handed. Some are edible and highly prized. Many are
				beautiful, serving as subjects for photographers and artists.
				All of them are useful in teaching aspects of mycology.</p>

					<p><strong>More Information:</strong> If you are unfamiliar
					with fungi and using keys, be sure to review the
					information on keys, the glossary, and some of the
					particulars about the species included in these keys.</p>

					<h2>Species Included in the Keys</h2>

					<p>A number of criteria were used to decide which species
					to include in the keys:</p>

					<p><strong>First</strong> - the fungus must display
					macroscopic characters (features visible with the unaided
					eye or with a 10x loupe) that are sufficiently distinctive
					to allow identification with reasonable certainty. Species
					with obscure features, or which can only be identified with
					the use of a microscope, are not included.</p>

					<p><strong>Second -</strong> preference was given to common
					species. I used cumulative species lists of Western Penn
					Mushroomers, Eastern Penn Mushroomers, New Jersey
					Mycological Association, field guides, my own collecting
					experience, and observations at NEMF and NAMA meetings to
					help determine which species to include. Although the
					emphasis is on common species, the keys do include some
					less commonly encountered species.</p>

					<p><strong>Third -</strong> the organism must utilize wood
					as a substrate. There is a degree of latitude with this
					criterion. Some species will be found only on living trees
					or on relatively intact dead wood. Others occur on wood
					that is quite decomposed (well-rotted) and just a few steps
					away from becoming soil. Similarly, I included a number of
					species which regularly appear on landscape bark mulch or
					similar substrates. Finally, some species are included
					which are typically described as terrestrial (on soil) but
					which may also at times occur on well-rotted wood. Keep in
					mind that certain species may appear terrestrial but in
					reality are attached to buried wood (e.g., roots) or to a
					tree trunk at the soil line.</p>

					<p><strong>Fourth -</strong> strictly resupinate poroid
					species were not included. If poroid, the organism had to
					be at least partly reflexed.</p>

					<p><strong>Fifth</strong> - the species must occur in
					Northeast North America. I consulted various references to
					ensure that all the species included in the keys are
					reported to occur in N.E. North America.</p>

					<p><strong>Sixth</strong> - with a few exceptions, slime
					molds were not included. The slime molds I included are
					quite common and fairly conspicuous. Some of these are:
					<em>Fuligo septica</em>, <em>Stemonitis</em> sp., and
					<em>Lycogala epidendrum</em>.</p>

				<h2>Dr. Gary Emberger</h2>

				<p>I'm a professor of biology at Messiah College where I've
				taught since 1981. My interest in fungi began in a formal
				manner through the introductory mycology course I took at Penn
				State. In spring term, 1974, I took BIOL 418 Mycology with Dr.
				C. Leonard Fergus as the instructor. Dr. Fergus loved the fungi
				and during the course I caught some of his passion for this
				group of organisms. As a result, I'm quite certain I'd still be
				involved with mushrooms as a hobby even if I did not teach
				mycology and biology as a profession. In any event, I combined
				my interest in plants with my new interest in mycology and
				completed graduate work in plant pathology at both Penn State
				and at North Carolina State University. While at NCSU, I took
				PP 625 Advanced Mycology in the fall of 1978, taught by Dr.
				Larry Grand. I still fondly remember staying up all night (the
				only time I ever did this) to complete a collection of fungal
				specimens to be turned in as part of the final grade. I
				reminded him of this at the 2004 NAMA meetings in North
				Carolina! In the plant pathology world of microscopic plant
				pathogens, PP 625 provided an interesting contrast in studying
				some of the macroscopic fungi. Larry is one of the contributing
				photographers for the site.</p>

				<p>In the early years of teaching mycology at Messiah College,
				my students collected a number of specimens which they could
				not identify. Neither could I with any confidence. Eastern Penn
				Mushroomers did not exist and I turned to Dr. Fergus at Penn
				State for help. He graciously offered his assistance. Many of
				the specimens I took to him were wood decay species. As I
				became more proficient at identifying wood decay fungi I
				appreciated their usefulness in teaching a mycology course with
				a field collection requirement. Even when conditions were too
				dry for terrestrial fungi, my students could almost always find
				fungi on logs, stumps, and decaying wood. In addition, many of
				the species are simply beautiful and often spectacular. My
				appreciation for this group of fungi continues to deepen over
				the years.</p>

				<p>Because of my contact with Dr. Fergus, I was aware of his
				book Illustrated Genera of Wood Decay Fungi. I was intrigued by
				the concept of a key to fungi which are restricted to a
				specific habitat, in this case, wood. The idea slowly developed
				in my mind that a web-based identification guide to fungi
				growing on wood would make for an interesting academic project.
				It would be an updated version of the out-of-print Illustrated
				Genera of Wood Decay Fungi. I felt a need existed for this kind
				of guide. And, can there ever be too many field guides to
				fungi? Following a time as department chair, the opportunity
				presented itself to pursue this project. I started work on the
				web site in 2003.</p>
