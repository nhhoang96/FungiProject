            <h2>What We Do</h2>

            <p> Fungi Growing on Wood is a web
                site devoted to the identification and appreciation of fungi
                growing in close association with living and dead wood. The
                fungi described here are those in a parasitic or saprophytic
                relationship with trees. Mycorrhizal fungi, also in close
                association with trees, are not strongly represented here even
                though some of them may be found on well-rotted wood. The
                organisms described on this web site are often referred to as
                lignicolous fungi. Most species are illustrated with multiple
                images to show as many diagnostic details as possible.</p

                <h2>Why Wood Decay Fungi?</h2>

                <p>Fungi which grow on wood are sometimes called
                    "lignicolous" fungi. But why develop a set of keys limited
                    to fungi utilizing wood as a substrate? After all, being
                    lignicolous does not define a taxonomic category.
                    Lignicolous fungi include ascomycetes and basidiomycetes
                    and a large number of classes and orders within each of
                    these groups. Most of these taxa include both lignicolous
                    and terrestrial species. Rather than taxonomy, the keys
                    focus on the biological activity holding this otherwise
                    disparate group of fungi together: their ability to degrade
                    cellulose and lignin, the major components of wood. This
                    ability is often judged negatively on our part. In fact,
                    the introduction to Illustrated Genera of Wood Decay Fungi
                    by Dr. Fergus states that "This manual has therefore been
                    prepared with the hope that it will fill a definite need,
                    that of the general forester to identify decay fungi. It
                    will also provide an illustrated Key for use in a Forest
                    Pathology Laboratory course." Dr. Fergus indicates that the
                    keys in his manual were based on those used by Dr. L.O.
                    Overholts for use in a course in Forest Pathology. Dr.
                    Fergus' book begins to answer the question posed earlier.
                    One reason you might want a set of keys to wood decay fungi
                    is because these fungi cause economic loss. Forest trees
                    and valuable landscape trees can be infected and rotted by
                    these fungi. Knowing the species growing on a tree can help
                    the forester determine the likely extent of loss. Different
                    species are associated with different amounts of decay in
                    the tree. Additionally, some species are restricted to
                    sapwood and will not affect the merchantable volume of
                    heartwood. Some fungi can decay sound wood, others decay
                    only decaying wood and bark.</p>

                <div id="button1">
                    <p>But being able to identify lignicolous fungi causing
                        economic loss is only one reason why keys to lignicolous
                        fungi might be useful. In the material below, I briefly
                        describe other important reasons people have to know the
                        species of fungi which are found growing on wood. Wood
                        decay fungi are the preeminant recyclers of wood in
                        ecosystems. Without these fungi, wood would never decay. We
                        would be "up to our eyeballs" in twigs, limbs, and tree
                        trunks. Worse, the valuable nutrients in this wood would be
                        locked up and unavailable for new growth. The species of
                        fungi responsible for decaying the wood of the different
                        species of hardwood and softwood trees is of ecological
                        interest. Wood decay fungi include many sought-after edible
                        species such as <i>Pleurotus ostreatus</i>, <i>Grifola
                            frondosa</i>, and <i>Laetiporus sulphureus</i>.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Wood decay fungi are used as mycomedicinals.
                            Preparations made from species such as <em>Ganoderma
                                lucidum</em> and <em>Trametes versicolor</em> are the
                            mycological equivalent of herbal medicinals.</li>

                        <li>Wood decay fungi are screened for pharmaceutical
                            and industrial compounds.</li>

                        <li>Wood decay fungi are favorite subjects for
                            photographers and other artists.</li>

                        <li>Wood decay fungi are used by hobbyists to dye wool
                            and other fabrics. <em>Trametes suaveolens</em>, for
                            example, yields a much sought purple dye.</li>

                        <li>Wood decay fungi are used by hobbyists to make
                            paper. Many of the species contain tough, fibrous cells
                            which, when separated, can be fashioned into ornamental
                            paper products.</li>

                        <li>Wood decay fungi utilize different proportions of
                            cellulose and lignin from wood, leading to what is
                            termed white rot or brown rot. This character is
                            sometimes given taxonomic importance. For example, most
                            species now in the genus <em>Oligoporus</em> were
                            formally included in the genus <em>Tyromyces</em>.
                            <em>Tyromyces</em>, however, is now restricted to white
                            rot species and any brown rot species formally in it
                            were transferred to the genus <em>Oligoporus</em> which
                            is restricted to brown rot species. For example,
                            <em>Oligoporus caesius</em> was formally <em>Tyromyces
                                caesius</em>.</li>

                        <li>Wood decay fungi provide fascinating examples of
                            biological relationships. For example, <em>Armillaria
                                mellea</em> is a much sought edible species. It is also
                            one of the few gilled mushrooms that is an important
                            forest tree parasite. <em>Armillaria mellea</em> is
                            sometimes parasitized by another gilled mushroom called
                            <em>Entoloma abortivum</em>, or the Aborted Entoloma. A
                            parasitized <em>Armillaria</em> becomes a more or less
                            solid mass of flesh and never develops gills. The two
                            species often grow near each other and for many years
                            it was thought that the aborted form was
                            <em>Entoloma</em> parasitized by <em>Armillaria</em>.
                            It was only in recent years that the reverse was shown
                            to be true. To call <em>Entoloma abortivum</em>, the
                            Aborted Entoloma, now makes little sense but will the
                            name change?</li>

                        <li>Wood decay fungi provide subjects for student
                            research projects. For example, students at Messiah
                            College have worked with me to study relationships of
                            wood decay fungi to plant species. This type of study
                            attempts to determine which wood decay fungi occur most
                            commonly on wood of a given species of tree. This sort
                            of study not only requires the identification of the
                            fungus but also the identification of the wood, a
                            formidable task at times given that most of these fungi
                            are found on dead logs and stumps in various states of
                            decay.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>A set of keys to fungi restricted to growing on wood
                        eases the identification process for people with all of the
                        above interests. Field guides and technical monographs
                        cover all genera and species of a group. The identification
                        process can become tedious for groups with many terrestrial
                        species or when using comprehensive field guides.
                        Furthermore, technical literature is often not available to
                        the general user as it may reside in obscure locations or
                        it may require more technical mycological "know how" than
                        that possessed by the general user.</p>

                    <p>For any of the activities described above, it is my hope
                        that these keys and pictures, within their limitations,
                        will be found useful to identify many of the fungi found
                        growing on wood.</p>
