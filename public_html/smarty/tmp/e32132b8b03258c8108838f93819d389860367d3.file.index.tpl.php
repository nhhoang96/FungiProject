            <h2>What We Do</h2>

            <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Fungi Growing on Wood is a web
                site devoted to the identification and appreciation of fungi
                growing in close association with living and dead wood. The
                fungi described here are those in a parasitic or saprophytic
                relationship with trees. Mycorrhizal fungi, also in close
                association with trees, are not strongly represented here even
                though some of them may be found on well-rotted wood. The
                organisms described on this web site are often referred to as
                lignicolous fungi. Most species are illustrated with multiple
                images to show as many diagnostic details as possible. To my
                knowledge, no guide similar to this exists.</p
