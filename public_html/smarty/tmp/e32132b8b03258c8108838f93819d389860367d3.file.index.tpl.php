                    <h2>Why Wood Decay Fungi?</h2>

                    <p>Fungi which grow on wood are sometimes called "lignicolous" fungi. But why develop a set of keys
                        limited to fungi utilizing wood as a substrate? After all, being lignicolous does not define a
                        taxonomic category. Lignicolous fungi include
                        <u data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="A fungus whose spores develop within asci including
                         molds, mildews, and yeasts">ascomycetes</u> and
                        <u data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="A fungus whose spores develop in basidia including
                        the majority of mushrooms and toadstools">basidiomycetes</u> and a large number of classes and orders
                        within each of these groups. Most of these taxa include both lignicolous and terrestrial species.
                        Rather than taxonomy, the keys focus on the biological activity holding this otherwise disparate
                        group of fungi together: their ability to degrade cellulose and lignin, the major components of wood.
                        This ability is often judged negatively on our part. In fact, the introduction to Illustrated Genera of Wood
                        Decay Fungi by Dr. Fergus states that "This manual has therefore been prepared with the hope that it will
                        fill a definite need, that of the general forester to identify decay fungi. It will also provide an
                        illustrated Key for use in a Forest Pathology Laboratory course." Dr. Fergus indicates that the
                        keys in his manual were based on those used by Dr. L.O. Overholts for use in a course in Forest Pathology. Dr.
                        Fergus' book begins to answer the question posed earlier. One reason you might want a set of keys to wood decay fungi
                        is because these fungi cause economic loss. Forest trees and valuable landscape trees can be infected and rotted by
                        these fungi. Knowing the species growing on a tree can help the forester determine the likely extent of loss. Different
                        species are associated with different amounts of decay in the tree. Additionally, some species are restricted to
                        <u data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="The soft outer layers of reccently formed wood between
                        the heartwood and the bark">sapwood</u> and will not affect the merchantable volume of heartwood.
                        Some fungi can decay sound wood, others decay only decaying wood and bark.</p>

                    <div id="button1"><!--hidden until read more is clicked...-->
                        <p>But being able to identify lignicolous fungi causing economic loss is only one reason why keys to lignicolous
                            fungi might be useful. In the material below, I briefly describe other important reasons people have to know the
                            species of fungi which are found growing on wood. Wood decay fungi are the preeminant recyclers of wood in
                            ecosystems. Without these fungi, wood would never decay. We would be "up to our eyeballs" in twigs, limbs, and tree
                            trunks. Worse, the valuable nutrients in this wood would be locked up and unavailable for new growth. The species of
                            fungi responsible for decaying the wood of the different species of hardwood and softwood trees is of ecological
                            interest. Wood decay fungi include many sought-after edible species such as
                            <u data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="An edible agaric with a soft greyish cap
                            growing in shelving masses on dead wood"><i>Pleurotus ostreatus</i></u>,

                            at the base of trees, particularly oaks"><i>Grifola frondosa</i></u>, and

                            and North America (grows on trees)"><i>Laetiporus sulphureus</i></u>.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Wood decay fungi are used as mycomedicinals.
                                Preparations made from species such as <u data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Known as Reishi
                                mushroom, is a popular medicinal mushroom used in Traditional Chinese Medicine"><em>Ganoderma lucidum</em>

                            <li>Wood decay fungi are screened for pharmaceutical and industrial compounds.</li>

                            <li>Wood decay fungi are favorite subjects for photographers and other artists.</li>

                            <li>Wood decay fungi are used by hobbyists to dye wool
                                and other fabrics. <u data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Trametes means 'one who is thin';

                                example, yields a much sought purple dye.</li>

                            <li>Wood decay fungi are used by hobbyists to make paper. Many of the species contain tough, fibrous cells
                                which, when separated, can be fashioned into ornamental paper products.</li>

                            <li>Wood decay fungi utilize different proportions of cellulose and lignin from wood, leading to what is
                                termed white rot or brown rot. This character is sometimes given taxonomic importance. For example, most
                                species now in the genus <u data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="A genus of fungi belonging
                                to the family Polyporaceae"><em>Oligoporus</em></u> were formally included in the genus
                                <u data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="A genus of fungi in the Polyporaceae family"><em>Tyromyces</em></u>.
                                <em>Tyromyces</em>, however, is now restricted to white rot species and any brown rot species formally in it
                                were transferred to the genus <em>Oligoporus</em> which is restricted to brown rot species. For example,
                                <em>Oligoporus caesius</em> was formally <em>Tyromyces caesius</em>.</li>

                            <li>Wood decay fungi provide fascinating examples of biological relationships. For example,
                                <u data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Commonly known as honey fungus, is
                                a basidiomycete fungus in genus Armillaria"><em>Armillaria mellea</em></u> is a much
                                sought edible species. It is also one of the few gilled mushrooms that is an important
                                forest tree parasite. <em>Armillaria mellea</em> is sometimes parasitized by another gilled mushroom called
                                <u data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="A steely gray entolomatoid mushroom found
                                near decaying wood in eastern North America's hardwood forests"><em>Entoloma abortivum</em></u>,
                                or the Aborted Entoloma. A parasitized <em>Armillaria</em> becomes a more or less
                                solid mass of flesh and never develops gills. The two species often grow near each other and for many years
                                it was thought that the aborted form was <em>Entoloma</em> parasitized by <em>Armillaria</em>.
                                It was only in recent years that the reverse was shown to be true. To call <em>Entoloma abortivum</em>, the
                                Aborted Entoloma, now makes little sense but will the name change?</li>

                            <li>Wood decay fungi provide subjects for student research projects. For example, students at Messiah
                                College have worked with me to study relationships of wood decay fungi to plant species. This type of study
                                attempts to determine which wood decay fungi occur most commonly on wood of a given species of tree. This sort
                                of study not only requires the identification of the fungus but also the identification of the wood, a
                                formidable task at times given that most of these fungi are found on dead logs and stumps in various states of
                                decay.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>A set of keys to fungi restricted to growing on wood eases the identification process for people with all of the
                            above interests. Field guides and technical monographs cover all genera and species of a group. The identification
                            process can become tedious for groups with many terrestrial species or when using comprehensive field guides.
                            Furthermore, technical literature is often not available to the general user as it may reside in obscure locations or
                            it may require more technical mycological "know how" than that possessed by the general user.</p>

                        <p>For any of the activities described above, it is my hope that these keys and pictures, within their limitations,
                            will be found useful to identify many of the fungi found growing on wood.</p>
