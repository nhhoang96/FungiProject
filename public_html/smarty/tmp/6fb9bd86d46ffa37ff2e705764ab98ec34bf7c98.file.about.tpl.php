				<h2>What We Do</h2>

				<p><strong>Area of Usefulness:</strong> The keys were developed	for fungi in the Northeastern United States. As with all
				regional keys, coverage decreases toward the periphery of the specified range. Many of the species included in these pages
				are distributed much more widely than the indicated area.</p>

				<p><strong>Approach to Identification:</strong> Identification of lignicolous fungi at this site requires the use of
				dichotomous keys based on macroscopic characters. By restricting the web site to lignicolous fungi, many, many other
				fungi are excluded. By excluding terrestrial fungi and fungi restricted to other substrates, a much smaller subset of
				organisms is defined. Consequently, the identification process is simplified.</p>

				<p><strong>Importance of Fungi on Wood:</strong> Lignicolous fungi are important. As a group, they play a vital role in
				recycling the nutrients locked up in wood. Economically, some species are capable of killing or damaging valuable timber and
				landscape trees. From a hobbyist perspective, no matter what time of year or the weather, it is almost always possible to
				find fungi on wood and they have saved many a foray from coming	up empty handed. Some are edible and highly prized. Many are
				beautiful, serving as subjects for photographers and artists. All of them are useful in teaching aspects of mycology.</p>

					<p><strong>More Information:</strong> If you are unfamiliar	with fungi and using keys, be sure to review the
					information on keys, the glossary, and some of the particulars about the species included in these keys.</p>

					<h2>Species Included in the Keys</h2>

					<p>A number of criteria were used to decide which species to include in the keys:</p>

					<p><strong>First</strong> - the fungus must display	macroscopic characters (features visible with the unaided
					eye or with a 10x loupe) that are sufficiently distinctive to allow identification with reasonable certainty. Species
					with obscure features, or which can only be identified with	the use of a microscope, are not included.</p>

					<p><strong>Second -</strong> preference was given to common species. I used cumulative species lists of Western Penn
					Mushroomers, Eastern Penn Mushroomers, New Jersey Mycological Association, field guides, my own collecting
					experience, and observations at NEMF and NAMA meetings to help determine which species to include. Although the
					emphasis is on common species, the keys do include some less commonly encountered species.</p>

					<p><strong>Third -</strong> the organism must utilize wood as a substrate. There is a degree of latitude with this
					criterion. Some species will be found only on living trees or on relatively intact dead wood. Others occur on wood
					that is quite decomposed (well-rotted) and just a few steps	away from becoming soil. Similarly, I included a number of
					species which regularly appear on landscape bark mulch or similar substrates. Finally, some species are included
					which are typically described as terrestrial (on soil) but which may also at times occur on well-rotted wood. Keep in
					mind that certain species may appear terrestrial but in	reality are attached to buried wood (e.g., roots) or to a
					tree trunk at the soil line.</p>

					<p><strong>Fourth -</strong> strictly resupinate poroid	species were not included. If poroid, the organism had to
					be at least partly reflexed.</p>

					<p><strong>Fifth</strong> - the species must occur in Northeast North America. I consulted various references to
					ensure that all the species included in the keys are reported to occur in N.E. North America.</p>

					<p><strong>Sixth</strong> - with a few exceptions, slime molds were not included. The slime molds I included are
					quite common and fairly conspicuous. Some of these are:
					<u data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="A species of plasmodial slime mold, a member of
					the Myxomycetes class. Commonly known as scrambled egg slime"><em>Fuligo septica</em></u>,
						<u data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="A genus of slime moulds characterised by tall
						brown sporangia, supported on slender stalks, grow on rotting wood"><em>Stemonitis</em> sp.</u>, and
					<u data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Known as wolf's milk, groening's slime is a cosmopolitan
					speies of plasmodial slime often mistaken for a fungus. The fruiting bodies occur on damp rotten wood">
						<em>Lycogala epidendrum</em></u>.</p>

				<h2>Dr. Gary Emberger</h2>

				<p>I'm a professor of biology at Messiah College where I've taught since 1981. My interest in fungi began in a formal
				manner through the introductory mycology course I took at Penn State. In spring term, 1974, I took BIOL 418 Mycology with Dr.
				C. Leonard Fergus as the instructor. Dr. Fergus loved the fungi	and during the course I caught some of his passion for this
				group of organisms. As a result, I'm quite certain I'd still be	involved with mushrooms as a hobby even if I did not teach
				mycology and biology as a profession. In any event, I combined my interest in plants with my new interest in mycology and
				completed graduate work in plant pathology at both Penn State and at North Carolina State University. While at NCSU, I took
				PP 625 Advanced Mycology in the fall of 1978, taught by Dr. Larry Grand. I still fondly remember staying up all night (the
				only time I ever did this) to complete a collection of fungal specimens to be turned in as part of the final grade. I
				reminded him of this at the 2004 NAMA meetings in North Carolina! In the plant pathology world of microscopic plant
				pathogens, PP 625 provided an interesting contrast in studying some of the macroscopic fungi. Larry is one of the contributing
				photographers for the site.</p>

				<p>In the early years of teaching mycology at Messiah College, my students collected a number of specimens which they could
				not identify. Neither could I with any confidence. Eastern Penn	Mushroomers did not exist and I turned to Dr. Fergus at Penn
				State for help. He graciously offered his assistance. Many of the specimens I took to him were wood decay species. As I
				became more proficient at identifying wood decay fungi I appreciated their usefulness in teaching a mycology course with
				a field collection requirement. Even when conditions were too dry for terrestrial fungi, my students could almost always find
				fungi on logs, stumps, and decaying wood. In addition, many of the species are simply beautiful and often spectacular. My
				appreciation for this group of fungi continues to deepen over the years.</p>

				<p>Because of my contact with Dr. Fergus, I was aware of his book Illustrated Genera of Wood Decay Fungi. I was intrigued by
				the concept of a key to fungi which are restricted to a	specific habitat, in this case, wood. The idea slowly developed
				in my mind that a web-based identification guide to fungi growing on wood would make for an interesting academic project.
				It would be an updated version of the out-of-print Illustrated Genera of Wood Decay Fungi. I felt a need existed for this kind
				of guide. And, can there ever be too many field guides to fungi? Following a time as department chair, the opportunity
				presented itself to pursue this project. I started work on the web site in 2003.</p>
