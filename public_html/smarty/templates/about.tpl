				<h2>Fungi Growing on Wood</h2>

				<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Fungi Growing on Wood is a web site devoted to the identification and appreciation of fungi growing in close
				association with living and dead woody plants. The fungi described here are those in a parasitic or saprotropic relationship with trees.
				Mycorrhizal fungi, also in close association with trees, are not strongly represented here even though some of them may be found on well-rotted
				wood. The organisms described on this web site are often referred to as lignicolous fungi. Most species are illustrated with multiple images
				to show as many diagnostic details as possible.</p>


				<p><strong>Area of Usefulness:</strong> The keys were developed	for fungi in the Northeastern United States. As with all
				regional keys, coverage decreases toward the periphery of the specified range. Many of the species included in these pages
				are distributed much more widely than the indicated area.</p>

				<p><strong>Approach to Identification:</strong> Identification of lignicolous fungi at this site requires the use of
				keys based on macroscopic characters. By restricting the web site to lignicolous fungi, many, many other
				fungi are excluded. By excluding terrestrial fungi and fungi restricted to other substrates, a much smaller subset of
				organisms is defined. Consequently, the identification process is simplified.</p>

				<p><strong>Importance of Fungi on Wood:</strong> Lignicolous fungi are important. As a group, they play a vital role in
				recycling the nutrients locked up in wood. Economically, some species are capable of killing or damaging valuable timber and
				landscape trees. From a hobbyist perspective, no matter what time of year or the weather, it is almost always possible to
				find fungi on wood and they have saved many a foray from coming	up empty handed. Some are edible and highly prized. Many are
				beautiful, serving as subjects for photographers and artists. All of them are useful in teaching aspects of mycology.</p>

				<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Certain wood decay fungi are edible.
					Others are toxic and some are deadly. Individual allergic reactions are always possible even with mushrooms
					generally considered safe. While every effort has been made to provide accurate information regarding edibility,
					where such information is appropriate, the primary purpose of this web site is to identify wild mushrooms growing on wood,
					not to guide the user to edible wild mushrooms. If the user chooses to eat wild mushrooms, doing so is at his or her own risk.
					Neither the author nor the Oakes Museum or Messiah College is responsible for decisions made as a result of using the keys and
					information found at this site. It is the responsibility of the individual to know for certain which species are edible or poisonous.
					One of the very best ways of gaining this knowledge is by joining a local mushroom club.
					The North American Mycological Association <a class="links" href="http://www.namyco.org/">(NAMA)</a>
					maintains links to local clubs throughout the country.</p>

					<p><strong>More Information:</strong> If you are unfamiliar	with fungi and using keys, be sure to review the
					information on keys, the glossary, and some of the particulars about the species included in these keys.</p>

					<hr>

					<h2>Species Included in the Keys</h2>

					<p>A number of criteria were used to decide which species to include in the keys:</p>

					<p><strong>First</strong> - the fungus must display	macroscopic characters (features visible with the unaided
					eye or with a 10x loupe) that are sufficiently distinctive to allow identification with reasonable certainty. Species
					with obscure features, or which can only be identified with	the use of a microscope, are not included.</p>

					<p><strong>Second -</strong> preference was given to common species. I used cumulative species lists of Western Penn
					Mushroomers, Eastern Penn Mushroomers, New Jersey Mycological Association, field guides, my own collecting
					experience, and observations at NEMF and NAMA meetings to help determine which species to include. Although the
					emphasis is on common species, the keys do include some less commonly encountered species.</p>

					<p><strong>Third -</strong> the organism must utilize wood as a substrate. There is a degree of latitude with this
					criterion. Some species will be found only on living trees or on relatively intact dead wood. Others occur on wood
					that is quite decomposed (well-rotted) and just a few steps	away from becoming soil. Similarly, I included a number of
					species which regularly appear on landscape bark mulch or similar substrates. Finally, some species are included
					which are typically described as terrestrial (on soil) but which may also at times occur on well-rotted wood. Keep in
					mind that certain species may appear terrestrial but in	reality are attached to buried wood (e.g., roots) or to a
					tree trunk at the soil line.</p>

					<p><strong>Fourth -</strong> strictly resupinate poroid	species were not included. If poroid, the organism had to
					be at least partly reflexed.</p>

					<p><strong>Fifth</strong> - the species must occur in Northeast North America. I consulted various references to
					ensure that all the species included in the keys are reported to occur in N.E. North America.</p>

					<p><strong>Sixth</strong> - with a few exceptions, slime molds were not included. The slime molds I included are
					quite common and fairly conspicuous. Some of these are:
					<u data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="A species of plasmodial slime mold, a member of
					the Myxomycetes class. Commonly known as scrambled egg slime"><em>Fuligo septica</em></u>,
						<u data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="A genus of slime moulds characterised by tall
						brown sporangia, supported on slender stalks, grow on rotting wood"><em>Stemonitis</em> sp.</u>, and
					<u data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Known as wolf's milk, groening's slime is a cosmopolitan
					speies of plasmodial slime often mistaken for a fungus. The fruiting bodies occur on damp rotten wood">
						<em>Lycogala epidendrum</em></u>.</p>

					<hr>
					<h2>Why Wood Decay Fungi?</h2>
					<p>Fungi which grow on wood are sometimes called "lignicolous" fungi.
						But why develop a set of keys limited to fungi utilizing wood as a substrate?
						After all, being lignicolous does not define a taxonomic category.
						Lignicolous fungi include <u data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="A fungus whose spores develop within asci including
                         molds, mildews, and yeasts">ascomycetes</u> and <u data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="A fungus whose spores develop in basidia including
                        the majority of mushrooms and toadstools">basidiomycetes</u> and a large number of classes and orders
						within each of these groups. Most of these taxa include both lignicolous and terrestrial species.
						Rather than taxonomy, the keys focus on the biological activity holding this otherwise disparate
						group of fungi together: their ability to degrade cellulose and lignin, the major components of wood.
						This ability is often judged negatively on our part. In fact, the introduction to
						<a class="links" href="http://www.amazon.com/Illustrated-genera-decay-Burgess-science/dp/B0006AWRQO">Illustrated Genera
						of Wood Decay Fungi</a> by Dr. Fergus states that "This manual has therefore been prepared with the hope
						that it will fill a definite need, that of the general forester to identify decay fungi.
						It will also provide an illustrated Key for use in a Forest Pathology Laboratory course."
						Dr. Fergus indicates that the keys in his manual were based on those used by Dr. L.O.
						Overholts for use in a course in Forest Pathology. Dr. Fergus' book begins to answer the
						question posed earlier. One reason you might want a set of keys to wood decay fungi is
						because these fungi cause economic loss. Forest trees and valuable landscape trees can
						be infected and rotted by these fungi. Knowing the species growing on a tree can help
						the forester determine the likely extent of loss. Different species are associated with
						different amounts of decay in the tree. Additionally, some species are restricted to
						<u data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="The soft outer layers of reccently formed wood between
                        the heartwood and the bark">sapwood</u> and will not affect the merchantable volume of heartwood.
						Some fungi can decay sound wood, others decay only decaying wood and bark.
					</p>

					<p>But being able to identify lignicolous fungi causing economic loss is only one reason why keys to
						lignicolous fungi might be useful. In the material below, I briefly describe other important
						reasons people have to know the species of fungi which are found growing on wood. Wood decay fungi
						are the preeminent recyclers of wood in ecosystems. Without these fungi, wood would never decay.
						We would be "up to our eyeballs" in twigs, limbs, and tree trunks. Worse, the valuable nutrients in
						this wood would be locked up and unavailable for new growth. The species of fungi responsible for
						decaying the wood of the different species of hardwood and softwood trees is of ecological interest.
						Wood decay fungi include many sought-after edible species such as <u data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="An edible agaric with a soft greyish cap
                            growing in shelving masses on dead wood"><i>Pleurotus ostreatus</i></u>,
						<u data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="A polypore mushroom that grows in clusters
                            at the base of trees, particularly oaks"><i>Grifola frondosa</i></u>, and <u data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="A species of bracket fungus found in Europe
                            and North America (grows on trees)"><i>Laetiporus sulphureus</i></u>.
					</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Wood decay fungi are used as mycomedicinals. Preparations made from species such as <u data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Known as Reishi
                                mushroom, is a popular medicinal mushroom used in Traditional Chinese Medicine"><em>Ganoderma lucidum</em></u>
							and <u data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Known as Coriolus versicolor and
                                Polyporus versicolor, is a common polypore mushroom found through the world. Also commonly
                                called Turkey Tail"><em>Trametes versicolor</em></u> are the mycological equivalent of herbal medicinals.</li>
						<li>Wood decay fungi are screened for pharmaceutical and industrial compounds.</li>
						<li>Wood decay fungi are favorite subjects for photographers and other artists.</li>
						<li>Wood decay fungi are used by hobbyists to dye wool and other fabrics.
							<u data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Trametes means 'one who is thin';
                                 Suaveolens means 'sweet-smelling' in reference to the anise scent of fresh specimens"><em>Trametes suaveolens</em></u>, for example, yields a much sought purple dye.</li>
						<li>Wood decay fungi are used by hobbyists to make paper. Many of the species contain tough,
							fibrous cells which, when separated, can be fashioned into ornamental paper products.</li>
						<li>Wood decay fungi utilize different proportions of cellulose and lignin from wood,
							leading to what is termed white rot or brown rot. This character is sometimes given taxonomic importance.
							For example, most species now in the genus <u data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="A genus of fungi belonging
                                to the family Polyporaceae"><em>Oligoporus</em></u> were formally included in the genus <u data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="A genus of fungi in the Polyporaceae family"><em>Tyromyces</em></u>.
							Tyromyces, however, is now restricted to white rot species and any brown rot species
							formally in it were transferred to the genus Oligoporus which is restricted to brown rot species.
							For example, Oligoporus caesius was formally Tyromyces caesius.</li>
						<li>Wood decay fungi provide fascinating examples of biological relationships.
							For example,  <u data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Commonly known as honey fungus, is
                            a basidiomycete fungus in genus Armillaria"><em>Armillaria mellea</em></u> is a much sought edible species.
							It is also one of the few gilled mushrooms that is an important forest tree parasite.
							Armillaria mellea is sometimes parasitized by another gilled mushroom called <u data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="A steely gray entolomatoid mushroom found
                                near decaying wood in eastern North America's hardwood forests"><em>Entoloma abortivum</em></u>, or the Aborted Entoloma. A parasitized Armillaria becomes a more or less solid
							mass of flesh and never develops gills. The two species often grow near each other and
							for many years it was thought that the aborted form was Entoloma parasitized by Armillaria.
							It was only in recent years that the reverse was shown to be true. To call Entoloma abortivum,
							the Aborted Entoloma, now makes little sense but will the name change?</li>
						<li>Wood decay fungi provide subjects for student research projects. For example, students at Messiah College have
							worked with me to study relationships of wood decay fungi to plant species.
							This type of study attempts to determine which wood decay fungi occur most commonly on wood of a
							given species of tree. This sort of study not only requires the identification of the fungus but also the identification of the wood,
							a formidable task at times given that most of these fungi are found on dead logs and stumps in various states of decay.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>A set of keys to fungi restricted to growing on wood eases the identification process for people with all of the above interests.
						Field guides and technical monographs cover all genera and species of a group.
						The identification process can become tedious for groups with many terrestrial species or
						when using comprehensive field guides. Furthermore, technical literature is often not available
						to the general user as it may reside in obscure locations or it may require more technical mycological
						"know how" than that possessed by the general user.
					</p>
					<p>For any of the activities described above, it is my hope that these keys and pictures,
						within their limitations, will be found useful to identify many of the fungi found growing on wood.

				<h2>Dr. Gary Emberger</h2>

				<p>I'm a professor of biology at Messiah College where I've taught since 1981. You can read more about the courses I teach, my interests,
				and other responsibilities at my Messiah College
					<a class="links" href="http://www.messiah.edu/a/academics/facultydir/faculty_profile.php?directoryID=9&entryID=430">home page</a>.
				</p>

				<p>My interest in fungi began in a formal manner through the introductory mycology course I took at Penn State.
					In spring term, 1974, I took BIOL 418 Mycology with Dr.
					C. Leonard Fergus as the instructor. Dr. Fergus loved the fungi	and during the course I caught some of his passion for this
					group of organisms. As a result, I'm quite certain I'd still be	involved with mushrooms as a hobby even if I did not teach
					mycology and biology as a profession. In any event, I combined my interest in plants with my new interest in mycology and
					completed graduate work in plant pathology at both Penn State and at North Carolina State University. While at NCSU, I took
					PP 625 Advanced Mycology in the fall of 1978, taught by Dr. Larry Grand. I still fondly remember staying up all night (the
					only time I ever did this) to complete a collection of fungal specimens to be turned in as part of the final grade. I
					reminded him of this at the 2004 NAMA meetings in North Carolina! In the plant pathology world of microscopic plant
					pathogens, PP 625 provided an interesting contrast in studying some of the macroscopic fungi. Larry is one of the contributing
					photographers for the site.</p>

				<p>In the early years of teaching mycology at Messiah College, my students collected a number of specimens which they could
				not identify. Neither could I with any confidence. Eastern Penn	Mushroomers did not exist and I turned to Dr. Fergus at Penn
				State for help. He graciously offered his assistance. Many of the specimens I took to him were wood decay species. As I
				became more proficient at identifying wood decay fungi I appreciated their usefulness in teaching a mycology course with
				a field collection requirement. Even when conditions were too dry for terrestrial fungi, my students could almost always find
				fungi on logs, stumps, and decaying wood. In addition, many of the species are simply beautiful and often spectacular. My
				appreciation for this group of fungi continues to deepen over the years.</p>

				<p>Because of my contact with Dr. Fergus, I was aware of his book <i>Illustrated Genera of Wood Decay Fungi</i>. I was intrigued by
				the concept of a key to fungi which are restricted to a	specific habitat, in this case, wood. The idea slowly developed
				in my mind that a web-based identification guide to fungi growing on wood would make for an interesting academic project.
				It would be an updated version of the out-of-print <i>Illustrated Genera of Wood Decay Fungi</i> - the need for which i still felt existed.
				And, can there ever be too many field guides to fungi? Following a time as department chair, the opportunity
				presented itself to pursue this project. I started work on the web site in 2003.</p>

				<p>Because Dr. Fergus had passed away some years earlier, I approached his son,
					Charles, with my idea of creating a web-based version of his father’s publication.
					Charles and his siblings graciously gave me permission to use and adapt material
					in <i>Illustrated Genera of Wood Decay Fungi</i>.
					Charles Fergus updated and republished one
					of his father's booklets dealing with mushrooms. It's called <i>Common Edible and
					Poisonous Mushrooms of the Northeast</i>. The book may be purchased through
					<a class="links" href="http://www.stackpolebooks.com/cgi-bin/stackpolebooks.storefront">Stackpole Books<a/>.

				<h3>Dr. Thomas Volk</h3>

				<p>In addition to sharing his pictures, Tom played a vital role in the early development of this web site.
					For this, I am very thankful. </p>

				<p>I applied for a sabbatical leave for the fall of 2003 after serving as department chair during the previous five years.
					My goal for the leave was to pursue scholarship activities in mycology. From talks I heard Tom give over the years,
					I appreciated, as a fellow teacher, his interest and passion for mycological education.
					Tom didn't know me very well but took a step of faith and agreed to collaborate with me.
					He provided encouragement and ideas to consider during the decision making process leading to
					the concept for this web site. His endorsement, as an external collaborator, was important in
					the approval process for my sabbatical. In the fall of 2003, as part of the sabbatical,
					I traveled to La Crosse, WI, and studied with Tom for a week. I sat in on one of his classes,
					went on several forays, met his graduate students, met some of his University colleagues,
					went on a mycology lab field trip, enjoyed the use of his lab, helped him dry apples,
					saw some great sights around La Crosse, and soaked up as much mycology as I could.
					Tom even planted a rhododendron at his home in my honor. Many thanks, Tom,
					for your hospitality and infectious love of fungi.
